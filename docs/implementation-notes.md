- there are passwords and other sensitive information hardcoded in configuration files. Such information in a real-world scenario should come via a secure mechanism e.g. via environment variables, services like KeyVault, build-time templating, etc. **Decision**: I will leave them as they are, not production ready.
- EmailService doesn't work since no component publishes an email.monthly-report message to the RabbitMQ it listens to. Having the service run all the time is also a waste of resources - I'd rather have a cronjob triggered once per month. With respect to timing, do we scale (parallel processing) with amount of users to send as close to month end as possible, or do we utilize timing to our advantage? Is there some time for settlement of transactions that needs to be considered? Can we send links to files instead of attachments (security should be considered differently)? Based on these we have other options, e.g. generating pdfs first and sending emails in batch at a given time; do we include e.g. transactions in the message?
